<h1>SciPy 2013 Conference Announcement</h1>

<p>SciPy 2013, the twelfth annual Scientific Computing with Python conference, will be held this June 24th-29th in Austin, Texas. SciPy is a community dedicated to the advancement of scientific computing through open source Python software for mathematics, science, and engineering. The annual SciPy Conference allows participants from academic, commercial, and governmental organizations to showcase their latest projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code development.</p>

<p>The conference consists of two days of tutorials by followed by two days of presentations, and concludes with two days of developer sprints on projects of interest to the attendees.</p>

<h2>Specialized Tracks</h2>

<p>This year we are happy to announce two specialized tracks run in parallel to the general conference:</p>

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

<p>In recent years, Python's machine learning libraries rapidly matured with a flurry of new libraries and cutting-edge algorithm implement and development occurring within Python. As Python makes these algorithms more accessible, machine learning algorithm application has spread across disciplines. Showcase your favorite machine learning library or how it has been used as an effective tool in your work!</p>

<h3>Reproducible Science</h3>

<p>Over recent years, the Open Science movement has stoked a renewed acknowledgement of the importance of reproducible research. The goals of this movement include improving the dissemination of progress, preventing fraud through transparency, and enabling deeper/wider development and collaboration. This track is to discuss the tools and methods used to achieve reproducible scientific computing.</p>

<h2>Domain-specific Mini-symposia</h2>

<p>Introduced in 2012, mini-symposia are held to discuss scientific computing applied to a specific scientific domain/industry during a half afternoon after the general conference. Their goal is to promote industry specific libraries and tools, and gather people with similar interests for discussions.</p>

<p>Mini-symposia on the following topics will take place this year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric and oceanic science</li>
  <li>Astronomy and astrophysics</li>
  <li>Medical imaging</li>
  <li>Bio-informatics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<p>Multiple interactive half-day tutorials will be taught by community experts. The tutorials provide conceptual and practical coverage of tools that have broad interest at both an introductory or advanced level. This year, a third track will be added, targeting specifically programmers with no prior knowledge of scientific python.</p>

<h2>Developer Sprints</h2>

<p>A hackathon environment is setup for attendees to work on the core SciPy packages or their own personal projects. The conference is an opportunity for developers that are usually physically separated to come together and engage in highly productive sessions. It is also an occasion for new community members to introduce themselves and recieve tips from community experts. This year, some of the sprints will be scheduled and announced ahead of the conference.</p>

<h2>Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Sessions</h2>

<p>Birds-of-a-Feather sessions are self-organized discussions that run parallel to the main conference. The BOFs sessions cover primary, tangential, or unrelated topics in an interactive, discussion setting. This year, some of the BOF sessions will be scheduled and announced ahead of the conference.</p>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

<ul>
  <li>April 15th: Speakers selected</li>
  <li>April 22nd: Sponsorship acceptance deadline</li>
  <li>May 1st: Speaker schedule announced</li>
  <li>May 5th: Paper submission deadline</li>
  <li>May 6th: Early-bird registration ends</li>
  <li>June 24th-29th: 2 days of tutorials, 2 days of conference, 2 days of sprints</li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to a very exciting conference and hope to see you all at the conference.</p>
